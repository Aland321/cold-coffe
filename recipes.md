Firstly, add 1 tablespoon of instant coffee to a bowl. If using brewed filter coffee or espresso you can add ¼ cup directly to the blender jar.
Add ¼ cup of warm water (not hot) to the instant coffee. Stir and mix very well.
Add the coffee solution to a blender jar.
Next add 3 to 4 tablespoons of sugar.
Blend for a minute or until the coffee solution becomes frothy and the color fades to a lighter shade of brown.
Add 6 or 7 ice cubes. For a thicker blended cold coffee use just 2 to 4 cubes of ice
Then pour in 2 cups of chilled milk (500 ml). To make this recipe, I used whole milk. 
Blend once for again just a few seconds, until everything is mixed well and you get a nice frothy and foamy layer on top.
Pour into tall glasses and serve cold coffee immediately. The frothy top layer will settle into the beverage as it sits, so it’s best to enjoy blended iced coffee right away
